\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

Electric vehicles are starting to grow in number, and their takeover of combustion engines is bound to happen, consequently to support such a thriving trend adequate easy access to charging stations is of utmost importance. In this landscape the goal of eMall is to allow owners of electric vehicles to easily know where charging stations are and carefully plan their charging process according to their schedules at any such station.\\
\\
This document will discuss goals and requirements that regard the system necessary to make eMall a reality, with the purpose of guiding the development process.

%Description of the System To Be:
%It is composed of the eMSP and one or more CPMSs ... description
%=> CPMS non va condiserato come actor perchè parte del STB

%Actor: User, DSO, CPO

%Consideration:
%CPMSs are not necessarily part of eMall, they might be entirely separated and can be reasonably assumed to exist independently.

%A CS has associated a DSO (one exactly at every instant) and is "plugged" thanks to it in the electric grid. The management of batteries is also handled per-CS.

%The user is charged a price that is exactly the energy he used times the original price he booked the CS for, hence eventual changes operated by the CPMS during the process that alter the cost of electricity do not affect the user's charge, simply the difference kept or given by the CPO/CPMS.

%A user should be able to show up whenever at a free socket and charge by "booking it on the fly" for the time window the socket is free!

%Machine: eMSPs + CPMSs
%World: Users + CS (charging stations) + Sockets + DSOs + CPOs

\section{Overall Description}
\label{section:overallDescription}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\label{subsubsec:scenarios}

\begin{description}
    \item [1. New user registration] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: Unregistered User} \\
        A person, Bob, who discovered eMall has decided to register into the platform to use its recharge booking and recharge management system. To this end Bob reaches the eMall services and chooses to “sign up”, after that Bob fills in the relevant information and his eMall account is created. Now Bob can proceed to login.
    \item [2. User login] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: Registered User} \\
        An already registered user, Bob, reaches the eMall services and intends to either book a charging spot or to manage a currently ongoing recharge booked to his name, hence Bob chooses to “login” and enters its credentials. Assuming Bob inserted valid credentials he now has a valid session within the eMall services. If Bob failed in setting valid credentials he can try again.
    \item [3. User looking for charging stations] \hfill \\
        \label{scenario:lookingForCS}
        \textit{Actors: Registered User} \\
        A user already registered on eMall, Bob, needs to know the location and/or pricing of CSs in a certain are of his interest. To obtain such data, Bob has reached the eMall services, has logged in and has selected the charging stations “search” options. Now Bob can search for CSs and is presented with multiple filters to control:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item His area of interest
            \item Recharge price ranges
            \item Connector types available
            \item Charging speeds available
        \end{itemize}
        By manipulating the filters Bob can restrict or widen the scope of his search. Results of the search are displayed in respect of the filters and Bob can see the details of every result such as:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Location
            \item Price
            \item Offers
            \item Booking schedule
            \item Available connectors
            \item Available charging speeds
        \end{itemize}
    \item [4. User booking a recharge] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: Logged-in User} \\
        A user Bob has already performed the login and now intends to book a recharge. Bob first performs a search for the CS to reserve for his recharge (see “user looking for charging stations” scenario) and once he finds a suitable and available one chooses “book recharge” for that station. Bob is then presented with the choice for the time slot for his recharge and once he chooses his reservation is completed.
    \item [5. User deleting one of his bookings] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: Logged-in User} \\
        A user Bob has already performed the login and recently made a few bookings on eMall. However on second thought Bob realized he could not make it in time for one of his bookings and now intends to delete it. To this end Bob selects the option to view his meetings' list on eMall and selects the meeting he desires to remove, he chooses the delete option the meeting list is updated with the deleted meeting now missing, confirming that eMall discarded it.
    \item [6. User performing a charging process (start, monitor and pay)] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: Logged-in User} \\
        The user Bob has previously booked a recharge at a certain CS for a certain time slot. Bob shows up at the CS during his reserved time slot and proceeds to connect his vehicle properly. Once the vehicle is connected Bob reaches the eMall services to start the charging process. After the process is started Bob has the option to interrupt it at any time, otherwise the charging procedure automatically halts as the CS noticed the vehicle’s battery being full or the booked time slot expires. Bob is notified by eMall as soon as the charging procedure ends. Immediately after completing a recharge, Bob is then presented by eMall with the total cost of his recharge and is automatically charged for the service on the payment method he inserted while registering.
    \item [7. User does not show up for a booked recharge] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: Registered User} \\
        The user Bob has previously booked a recharge at a certain CS for a certain time slot. However Bob forgot about the booking and did not show up to the booked CS during the time slot for the recharge, hence he is notified by eMall after the time slot expires and is charged a fee from eMall. Obviously had Bob deleted the meeting beforehand he would have avoided the fee.
    \item [8. CPO wants information on DSOs’ energy prices and mix of sources] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: CPO} \\
        The CPO Xcorp, or better its employee Mary which authorizes herself with Xcorp's CPMS, wants all information regarding the energy market to evaluate their choice of a DSO. To do this Xcorp uses its CPMS’s functionality to gather such information from all the DSOs known to it, hence the CPMS proceeds to recover this information from the various DSOs and once it has finished it presents the result to Xcorp.
    \item [9. CPO chooses energy sources and battery usage policies for a CS] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: CPO} \\
        The CPO Xcorp might want to change which DSO supplies its different CSs and how the CSs manage their batteries, if they have any, in order to offer better prices, to cut its expenses or take advantage of better energy mixes provided by other DSO. To this end Xcorp instructs one of its employees, Mary, to authenticates with Xcorp's CPMS. Afterwards Mary selects the CS(s) which will be subject to changes and can choose to assign that CS(s) a new DSO among those the CPMS is aware of or to change the battery usage policy for that CS(s).
    \item [10. CPO toggles the CPMS automatic mode] \hfill \\
        \textit{Actors: CPO} \\
        A CPO employee, Mary, in charge of administering the CPMS system wants to change its operating mode from “Manual” to “Automatic”. To do this, she logs in to the CPMS and toggles “Automatic Mode” on. Once the system has finished changing the operating mode, she loses control over manual overrides, and is prompted to enable “Manual Mode” again in order to change those settings. After completing the action, Mary successfully logs out of the system. \hfill \\
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Class Diagram}

UML class diagram showing the entities of interest for the system and their relationships. \\
\\
A notably missing entity is \textit{vehicle}, which was deemed not necessary, since its charge status is modelled within the socket it is connected to and the user might not necessarily be the owner of the vehicle he recharges (ex: rented vehicle), so binding the two might have been counterproductive. \\
\\
\textit{Unregistered User} is not present and modelled as a flag of User. !!SHOULD WE MODEL IT? Since its not connected to any booking, a significant difference with User...!!

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{subsec:prodfunctions}

\subsubsection{User registration}

eMall will allow Users to register an account. A User will register by entering:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A desired UserName
    \item Their email address
    \item A password
    \item A payment method
\end{itemize}
Given those data the account will be created and will be available to the User. This functionality will allow only one account to be bound to a specific email address.

\subsubsection{Search for CSs}
\label{subsubsection:searchForCS}

Users with an account will be able to search for CSs, multiple selectors will be available to narrow or widen the scope of the search, hence allowing Users to find the best result for their needs. Available filters will be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geographical area of interest
    \item Reharge price ranges
    \item Connector types available
    \item Charging speeds available
\end{itemize}
Users will be able to select a specific CS, consequently seeing the already booked time slots for it and further details as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Location
    \item Price
    \item Offers
    \item Booking schedule
    \item Available connectors
    \item Available charging speeds
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Book a recharge at a CS}

From the list of results for the \hyperref[subsubsection:searchForCS]{\textbf{search for a CS}} a User will be able to book a recharge at a CS, they will be able to select a specific socket and time slot among the available ones for the CS and reserve it for themselves. During their booked time slot they will then have to show up at the CS with their vehicle to perform the recharge.

\subsubsection{Perform a recharge at a CS}

When the User show up at a CS during the time slot the booked it for and they connect to the booked socket they will be able to log into eMall, reach their bookings and start the charging process for the one they are currently connected for. Once the charging process is going, the User will be able to interrupt it through eMall at any time, otherwise the recharge will terminate after the vehicle is fully charged or the time slot expires, notifying the User. After the completion of a recharge the User will be charged by eMall for the service.

\subsection{Acquire price and energy mix information from DSOs}

A CPO will be able to ask their CPMS to present them with the information regarding energy prices and mix of energy sources used by the different DSOs known to the system. The CPMS will recover the information from DSOs and return it to the CPO.

\subsubsection{Choose the energy sources and battery usage policies for a CS}

The CPMS will provide its CPO with a list of all CSs handled by the system, from that list the CPO will be able to modify the configuration of each CS independently, specifically they will be able to alter the DSO that is currently supplying that CS and the policy with which that CS used its batteries. \\
The CPO will as well be able to let the CPMS take those decisions automatically on their behalf.

\subsection{User Characteristics}

\begin{description}
    \item [1. Unregistered User] \hfill \\
        A User which just accesses the list of available CS without being able to book recharges, he has the option to register and become a \textit{Logged-In User} at any time.
    \item [2. Registered User] \hfill \\
        A User with a registered account within eMall which has yet to login-in with their credentials.
    \item [2. Logged-In User] \hfill \\
        A User with a registered account within eMall which has logged in via their credentials, can still access the CSs list and can also book a recharge. With their bookings he can then manage their charging sessions one he arrives at the CS.
    \item [3. CPO] \hfill \\
        By CPO at large we mean a company whose employees have access to the company's CPMS, hence the actual human beings interacting with the STB will be CPO employees with credentials that allow them to authenticate with the CPMS. The tasks an employee might perform are acquiring DSOs' information, assigning a DSO to a CS owned by their company, changing the battery management policy for any CS controlled by the CPMS or adding/updating CS managed by the CPMS. \\
        The reason for CPOs being identified as a users instead of their employees is that the decisions justifying the operations performed by the employees cannot be taken by the employees, they are just the executors, decisions are taken by their superiors, hence we can view of the entire company as a user to avoid being too specific about who takes which decision and who interacts with the STB. \\
        Furthermore a CPO is likely to use its information system to interface with the CPMS, hence identifying the company as a user also prevents distintions between direct CPMS access or access via the information system.

\section{Specific Requirements}
\label{section:specificRequirements}

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

The interface eMall will use is a web app, through which its Users will have available all \hyperref[subsec:prodfunctions]{product functions}. Such web app will need to be usable both on desktop and mobile devices, since a mobile device is what users will most likely have available to them while at the CS. \\
\\
MOCKUPS HERE \\
\\
Similarly, CPMSs will offer their functionality to CPOs via a web portal, here there is no need to support anything other than a desktop device, since CPMSs are intended to be managed by employees in a company environment.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

Users will require a device equipped with a web browser and an internet connection to access the eMall website, the hardware architecture of the specific device is irrelevant as long as it runs an OS equipped with a web browser. \\
\\
CPOs will as well only require a device capable of web browsing, although in this case such device is intended to a be a desktop machine since its users will be the employees working at the CPOs from their offices. \\
\\
CSs will need to be equipped with adequate hardware to monitor each socket and control circuitry for their batteries, if there are any connected to them. Furthermore CSs need to connect to and communicate with their respective CPMSs, hence a small computer within each CS capable of collecting sockets and battery(ies) data as well as interface with the internet (via 4G or a wired connection) is necessary. \\
Furthermore this document will assume that a CS is billed for its used electricity via a in loco electricity meter independently monitored by the DSO currently assigned to the CS by the CPMS.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
%The information exchanged between different SW entities in the same "location"

Devices in the end of eMSP users will require an OS equipped with a network stack within which to run a web browser. The same is true on the CPOs side, on their machines there need to be an OS with network capabilities suitable for a web browser. \\
\\
%A software dedicated to handling payments is required for the eMSP, in order to allow it to charge users when needed using the payment method details stored by the eMSP. Such software needs to be invokeable by the eMSP at any time. \\
%\\
The computer installed on CS will need to have an OS with networking capabilities too, while also having adequate software to collect and process the information coming from the CS's sockets and eventually connected vehicles, as well as to manage eventual batteries connected to the CS.

%Map service and payment system...

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
%The medium over which information is exchanged

%ADD: interface for the CS that automatically connect to the CPMS on their own!

The main functionalities of the STB require cooperation of multiple components sometimes owned by different parties and not deployed on machines in the same local network, hence their interactions occur via adequate web APIs. The interactions requiring such interfaces are the following:

\begin{description}
    \item [1. eMSP acquiring CS information from CPMSs] \hfill \\
        Whenever a search for CSs, a booking or a recharge at a CS is performed via an eMSP, the ladder needs to fetch information regarding one or more CSs from CPMSs first, hence CPMSs need to expose a web API reachable by the eMSP to communicate the details regarding CSs.
    \item [2. eMSP  managing a recharge through a CPMS] \hfill \\
        When a charging process for a previous booking needs to be starter or terminated by a user via the eMSP, the eMSP has no control over the CS, hence needs to interface with the CPSM to request the latter to start/stop the charging process. Hence the CPMS needs to expose in it web API method for eMSP to start/stop charging procedures that were booked through them.
    \item [3. eMSP requesting a payment via an external provider] \hfill \\
        After the completion of a charging process or when a fee is charged to a user, the eMSP needs to use the payment method a user has bound to its account to charge them for the service, hence it needs to interface with an API which will allow the eMSP to have the amount due accredited to himself.
    \item [4. CPMS monitoring and controlling its CSs] \hfill \\
        CSs need to know how to reach the CPMS responsible for them over internet, this way whenever a CS is deployed it will automatically find its CPMS, authenticate with it and setup itself under its control. To this end CPMSs need to expose a web API allowing for new CSs to authenticate with them, and CSs need to offer the connect CPMS and endpoint to allow it to manage them.
    \item [5. CPMS acquiring DSOs price and energy mix information] \hfill \\
        To allow CPMSs to know their energy prices and mixes, DSO must have an API available via web so that CPMSs can recover such information.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
% LO METTIAMO IN TABELLA (VEDI COMMENTI CAMILLI)????
The system should be able to handle concurrent users, who may want to book or start a recharge at the same time in different geographical locations. As such, the systems should be capable of handling a reasonably high number of concurrent users, which we hypothesize to be in the order of 10.000. \\
Secondly, the system should operate with reasonable response times (of max 5 seconds), necessary to provide timely feedback to users who are booking or paying for a recharge, as well as users who want to start their recharge quickly. \\
Finally, the system should work properly even when accessed from a low-speed connectivity, such as 3G networks, since it is expected that users who might want to start a recharge through the system are probably going to access it through their mobile phone. As such, the overall amount of data exchanged with the user should be kept at a minimum. \\

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
The system should adhere to the standards and regulations imposed by the GDPR privacy law, since it is expected to be deployed (entirely or partially) in European countries. \\
Secondly, the APIs used for communications between the eMSP and CPMSs, as well as APIs used to share data between other parties in the STB should follow the current industry standard for API design which, at the time of writing, is the REST architecture. \\
Finally, the STB should function as expected on all modern web browser, without loss of functionalities according to the browser chosen by the user. 

\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
Given that the system will be accessed from the Web and will require a connection to the platform to carry out its functions, the hardware must support some form of Internet connectivity (such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet or Cellular) and must have at least one modern Browser installed. \\
Furthermore, given that it is expected that the STB is mostly going to be accessed on mobile devices, it should not require a high processing power in order to perform its front-end functions. \\

\subsubsection{Any other constraint}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
%Io prendo il treno, ciao, a domani!
%OK a domani!
\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system should be highly reliable and be up and running most of the times, since without it the user would not be able to start a recharge previously booked by the system. Hence regular maintenance is expected, together with some precautions that help reduce the risk of total outages in case of failures (e.g. geographical redundancy).

\subsubsection{Availability}
High availability is crucial for this system for 2 main reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Its entire business model is based off of transactions made through the system (users booking and, later, paying for recharges)
    \item Users need the system to be up and running in order to start a recharge, even if it was already booked
\end{itemize}
Taking this into consideration, it is deemed appropriate to have an availability of 99.99\%, which would result in a maximum of approximately 52 minutes of downtime in an entire year. To achieve such a high figure, it may be essential to run components in parallel, making use of redundant machines and databases. \\
Furthermore, since the system also relies on external components (including, but not limited to the systems owned by DSOs), it should be noted that these systems may have lower availability constraints, and as such our STB should not fail entirely due to the failure of such dependencies.

\subsubsection{Security}
Since the STB has to deal with highly confidential user data (including, but not limited to billing information), the latest security standards should be applied. In practice, this boils down to the adoption of secure protocols for transferring information over the Internet (e.g. HTTPS), actively checking the authorization status of a user when they attempt to access a resource or a specific endpoint, as well as proper encryption of passwords when stored into the system.
%RIFRASARE O TOGLIERE????
Prevent an asshole to create 1 trillion accounts and occupy all of a city worth of CS, hence require credit card info on registration!

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The system should be easily maintainable, to allow for future expansion of its feature set without requiring to build it from scratch. As such, standard software patterns should be adopted, and the whole architecture and underlying code should be properly and extensively documented, to allow potential future developers to start working on it without reading the entire code base.

\subsubsection{Portability}
As mentioned in previous sections, the system should be accessible both on a Desktop browser and on Mobile ones, therefore its interface should be fully responsive to adapt to different screen sizes. Futhermore, the system should be able to run on a wide variety of modern browsers, without feature restrictions for some of them.
