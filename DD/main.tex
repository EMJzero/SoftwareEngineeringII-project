\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

Electric vehicles are starting to grow in number, and their takeover of combustion engines is bound to happen, consequently to support such a thriving trend adequate easy access to charging stations is of utmost importance. In this landscape the goal of eMall is to allow owners of electric vehicles to easily know where charging stations are and carefully plan their charging process according to their schedules at any such station. \\
\\
This document will follow up on the RASD document with a discussion of the architectural design of the system, its main architectural components and their interfaces. It will also cover the plans for implementation and integration, as well as those for testing, with the goal of guiding the development process. \\

\subsection{Overview}

The architecture of the system is organized in \textbf{four layers} distributed over \textbf{four tiers} in a thin client fashion, this results in a monolithic structure that benefits security and maintenance. To be noted however that the modular design of the architecture is already predisposed to allow an easy transitions to microservices when, if ever, the load imposed on the system will require the distribution of its functionalities over many machines. \\

\subsubsection{Client Device}

Client devices represent all the devices connected to the internet and used to reach the eMall website. By reaching eMall the \textbf{eMSP Web Application Component} in the form of an interactive web application is loaded by the device's web browser and eMall's UI is shown to the User.\\
\\
The \textbf{eMSP Web Application Component} is the front-end that it offers to its Users, it consists of a website offering an interactive web application with a UI that allows Users to access every function offered by eMall. This component does not integrate computational intensive tasks and in itself does not have any data that can instead be provided by eMall's back-end. Its functionalities are limited to error checking, UI rendering and contacting the eMSP's back-end to recover any data needed to offer the User the intended functionalities.

\subsubsection{eMSP Web Server Component}

The eMSP Web Server is required in order to serve the eMSP Web Application to User, and to allow such Web App to interact with the eMSP's back-end when needed. \\
\\
To this end its main sub-component is a \textbf{Request Router}, a Reverse Proxy component that sits in front of the back-end and routes requests from client devices to the back-end services capable of satisfying them, this way the resources returned to clients appear as if they originated from the Web Server itself. \\
The role of the Reverse Proxy is also to help increase scalability, performance, resilience and security by both acting as a content cache and as a middleware before the back-end. 

\subsubsection{eMSP Application Server Component}

The back-end for the eMSP, as per the hierarchy of components, every request reaching it is first checked for an active session, and only those with one which has a performed valid login are allowed access to components other than \textbf{Register}. \\
Every component present performs all the required checks on the received data to correctly perform any of its functions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication} \\
        Sub-component that handles the authentication by checking the credentials for every request reaching the back-end.
    \item \textbf{Login} \\
        Sub-component which checks the login credentials inserted by Users through the Web App and grants them an authenticated session if those are valid.
    \item \textbf{Register} \\
        Sub-component that allows Unregistered Users to create a new account with eMall.
    \item \textbf{SearchCS} \\
        Sub-component whose purpose is to allow authenticated Users to query eMall for the CSs it has available with the use of filters. It returns the list of matching CSs.
    \item \textbf{BookingsManager} \\
        Sub-component offering the functionalities to both create a new booking and receive the current list of bookings for the authenticated User, with the possibility of deleting any booking. 
    \item \textbf{RechargeManager} \\
        Sub-component which allows for control over a booking which is currently active, after a User has connected their vehicle to a booked CS, via this component they can start/stop the charging process as well as get notified of the process terminating.
    \item \textbf{PaymentModule} \\
        Sub-component that interfaces with an external payment provider and allows the eMSP to charge Users for any obtained service or fee if they were not to show up for a booking.
    \item \textbf{DataAccess} \\
        Sub-component that provides access to the DataBase for every other sub-component.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CPO Device}

CPO Devices represent all the machines available to CPO Employees to operate with the company's CPMS. \\
\\
The \textbf{CPMS Web Application Component} is meant to be ran inside a web browser on the CPO Devices and consequently be available to CPO Employees, it is the front-end offered by the CPMS and its UI is meant to offer to its users all the management functionalities of the CPMS. This component does not integrate computational intensive tasks and does not store locally any data that can instead be provided by the CPMS's back-end. Its functionalities are limited to error checking, UI rendering and contacting the CPMS's back-end to recover any data required for its functionalities.

\subsubsection{CPMS Web Server Component}

The CPMS Web Server is required in order to serve the CPMS Web Application to CPO Employees, to allow such Web App to interact with the CPMS's back-end and to allow CS to reach the CPMS with a WebSocket connection, allowing the CPMS to actively manage them. \\
\\
To this end its main sub-components are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Request Router} \\
        A reverse proxy that sits between a client and the CPMS back-end, its role is to route requests from clients to the back-end services capable of answering them, this way the resources resources returned to clients appear as if they originated from the Web Server itself. The role of the Reverse Proxy is also to help increase scalability, performance, resilience and security by both acting as a content cache and as a middleware before the back-end.
    \item \textbf{WebSocket Proxy} \\
        Its role is to tunnel WebSocket connections between the CPMS back-end and the CSs, after those are originated from upgrade requests over HTTP that went through the Request Router.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CPMS Application Server Component}

The back-end for the CPMS, every request reaching it is let through to the CPO-only components only if it has an active authenticated session with CPO credentials. Access to components that are meant for eMSPs is granted to all eMSPs that are known by the system as long as their request are correctly performed with an authenticated session. \\
Every component present performs all the required checks on the received data to correctly perform any of its functions.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentication} \\
        Sub-component that handles the authentication by checking the credentials for every request reaching the back-end.
    \item \textbf{Login} \\
        Sub-component which checks the login credentials inserted by CPO Employees through the Web App and grants them an authenticated session if those are valid.
    \item \textbf{CSBatteryPolicyManager} \\
        Sub-component that allows CPOs to change the policy currently in use by a CS to manage its batteries, it both saves to the CPMS's DataBase updated CS policies as well as requests the \textbd{CSManager} to communicate the updated policies to the actual CS.
    \item \textbf{CSDSOManager} \\
        Sub-component that allows CPOs to change the DSO currently supplying a CS, it both saves to the CPMS's DataBase updated CS's DSO as well as requests the \textbd{CSManager} to communicate the change to the actual CS.
    \item \textbf{CSPricesManager} \\
        Sub-component that allows CPOs to change the user-price, the nominal-price and the offer reset date of a CS, it both saves to the CPMS's DataBase updated prices and date as well as requests the \textbd{CSManager} to communicate the updated values to the actual CS.
    \item \textbf{AutomaticModeManager} \\
        Sub-component which allows CPO Employees to toggle the operating mode of the CPMS from “Automatic Mode” to “Manual Mode” or vice-versa, as well as allowing the CPO to update the CPMS’s policy for “Automatic Mode”.
    \item \textbf{CSList} \\
        Sub-component providing the CPO and external eMSPs with the list of CS currently under the control of the CPMS. It also accepts filters to reduce the list of provided CSs. If they are requested, details regarding a specific CS can also be provided by this component.
    \item \textbf{RechargeManager} \\
        Sub-component providing external eMSPs with the possibility of managing, on behalf of their Users, the ongoing charging process to a certain socket of a CS. This module also provides the eMSP feedback on the current status of the charging process. This component dialogues with the \textbd{CSManager} to gather the CS status and forward it commands to manage the charging process.  
    \item \textbf{DSOInformation} \\
        Sub-component providing the CPO with information regarding the DSOs known by the CPMS. This module also interfaces directly with the DSOs external API to gather their prices and energy mixes. 
    \item \textbf{CSManager} \\
        Sub-component that allows the other back-end components to dialogue with CSs, know their real-time status, coordinate their charging processes and update their configuration. CS signal this module when one of their recharges is complete, and this module forwards such notification to the eMSP. This module also accepts WebSocket connections from CS to allow their management.
    \item \textbf{DataAccess} \\
        Sub-component that provides access to the DataBase for every other sub-component.
\end{itemize}
